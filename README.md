# Chiaki 4 iOS

This is a fork of the Chiaki macOS GUI application with the goal to make it work on iOS.

Current state:

* The discovery manager doesn't work at the moment due to an entitlement issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65490312/multicast-networking-entitlement-on-ios-14). Adding hosts manual should work.
* Videotoolbox doesn't work and will lead to BAD_EXEC errors.
* Audio doesn't work: Audio Format with 2 channels @ 48000 Hz not supported by Audio Device
* Register button is unresponsive. Just enter after typing the pin code

# These scripts are used to build the necessary libraries:

* https://github.com/chrisballinger/Opus-iOS/tree/master
* https://github.com/kewlbear/FFmpeg-iOS-build-script
