# Chiaki 4 iOS

This fork of the Chiaki macOS GUI application tries to make it working on iOS.

Current state:

* The discovery manager doesn't work at the moment due to an entitlement issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65490312/multicast-networking-entitlement-on-ios-14). Adding hosts manual should work.
* Videotoolbox doesn't work and will lead to BAD_EXEC errors.
* Audio doesn't work: Audio Format with 2 channels @ 48000 Hz not supported by Audio Device
